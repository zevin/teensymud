= TeensyMUD Server
= v2.10.0

== Introduction
TeensyMUD is a very simple mud server written in Ruby.  It uses a multiplexed single-threaded network driver using Acceptor/Reactor and Observer patterns and YAML formatted text files as a database.  It is also a pure event driven system where all game objects communicate with each other via events.  

This server was initially created in response to an Aprils Fool's joke posted by Erwin Andreasen on TheMudConnector forum announcing a 1K mud contest.  Those obfuscated versions can be found in the repository.

== Download
The latest release can be found at http://teensymud.kicks-ass.org

== System Dependencies
=== Required
[Ruby 1.8.4] Can be obtained at the home of Ruby, http://www.ruby-lang.org.  It runs on most platforms.
[Log4r] All logging done through this now. Install from Ruby Gems, or http://log4r.sourceforge.net/ 

=== Optional
[RubyGems] To install rake and various things.  See - http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems
[Rake] To build documentation, run tests, etc.  See - http://rake.rubyforge.org
[Racc] To rebuild FARTS or BoolExp parser.  Ruby comes with Racc runtime so this is not needed for execution. See - http://i.loveruby.net/en/prog/racc.html
[FlexMock] To run regression tests.  See - http://onestepback.org/software/flexmock/
[Curses] To run tclient in curses mode under windows.  The Windows one-click installer may be missing the pdcurses.dll, or if you built it yourself from source the curses.so extension probably wasn't built.  You can get binaries for it at http://www.dave.burt.id.au/ruby/curses.zip.  The pdcurses.dll should be placed in your ruby\bin directory and not your windows directories.   See http://jarp.does.notwork.org/win32/ for the sources.

== Installation

1. $ tar xzvf tmud*
2. $ cd tmud*
3. $ ruby tmud.rb

That's it.  It will boot on port 4000 and build an initial database in the db directory. 

See config.yaml file for more configuration information.  Documentation inside.

== Starting the mud

Usage: ruby ./tmud.rb [options]

    -p, --port PORT                  Select the port the mud will run on
    -d, --dbfile DBFILE              Select the name of the database file
                                       (default is 'db/world.yaml')
    -c, --config CONFIGFILE          Select the name of the configuration file
                                       (default is 'config.yaml')
    -l, --logfile LOGFILE            Select the name of the log file
                                       (default is 'logs/server.log')
    -h, --home LOCATIONID            Select the object id where new characters will start
    -t, --[no-]trace                 Trace execution
    -v, --[no-]verbose               Run verbosely
        --help                       Show this message
        --version                    Show version

Options specified on the command line will override those in the config.yaml file.

There is a sample database, db/testworld.yaml that illustrates the use of triggers.  The admin account is 'Wizard' and the password is 'potrzebie'.

To start using the sample database either specify it in the config file or on the command line:

* $ ruby tmud.rb --dbfile db/testworld

There are two converted databases from the original tinymud and dikumud.  The admin account on both is 'Wizard' and the password is 'potrzebie'.  To run with those use:

* $ ruby tmud.rb --dbfile db/tinyworld --home 17
* $ ruby tmud.rb --dbfile db/dikuworld --home 13

The TinyMud scripts are only partially operable, which may severely restrict your movement.

See db/license.tiny and db/license.diku for more informtion.
